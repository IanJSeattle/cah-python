# vi: set wm=9:

[finished]
add note when a player joins the game, something like "welcome
{playername}, waiting for {num} more players before starting"

[finished]
double "start" command announces a new game is starting again.  fix start
so it won't respond or gives an error if there's already a game underway.

[finished]
implement the 'shame' command

[finished]
add a 'leave'/'quit' command so a player can leave the game

[finished]
print index numbers for judge choices once all the cards are in

[finished]
status command should print out card choices in wait_czar

[finished]
once a winner is picked, maybe try running round 2 (tied to endgame
code, problably)

[finished]
new round should add a card to everyone's hand

[finished]
non-czar shouldn't be able to pick a winner

[finished]
'pick 3' cards should add cards to player's hand

[finished]
deal with the game-winning scenario (ie, announce a win when one player
gets to config['max_points'])

[finished]
when 0 players are left after a leave/quit, set game state to inactive
and lose stats related to the previous game

[finished]
add a 'help' command that lists available commands and a help blurb

[finished]
when the current czar quits, re-assign the czar appropriately

[finished]
add a 'reload' command to reload the config file (cards are already
reloaded for each new game)

[finished]
give players feedback when picking a card

[finished]
"reaper" and "reaper-dis" are treated as the same user.  wtf?
alternately, the "you already played this round" counter isn't getting
reset each round

[finished]
fix handling of questions without a %s in them (ie, answer at end)

[finished]
game winner announcement uses player instead of player.nick

[finished]
"you played this card" text is not privmsgd to a player

[finished]
new player in game isn't dealt cards

[no longer required]
new player with no cards who attempts to play a non-existent card kills
the bot with "card referenced before instantiated"

[finished]
on the announcement that prompts the czar to pick a winner, mention the
czar's name

add sqlite database to track stats

in round 14, i played BATTER, but still had it the next round. looks
like this has happened multiple times, too.  write a test to check
carefully that selected answers are really getting taken out of the
player decks -- test doesn't find the behavior now, and a quick
playtest didn't see it either in a few rounds

add '[pick 2] [draw 1]' to the end of multi-field cards.  logic: print
this out if there's a draw value greater than zero.
