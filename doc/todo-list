[finished]
add note when a player joins the game, something like "welcome
{playername}, waiting for {num} more players before starting"

[finished]
double "start" command announces a new game is starting again.  fix start
so it won't respond or gives an error if there's already a game underway.

[finished]
implement the 'shame' command

[finished]
add a 'leave'/'quit' command so a player can leave the game

when 0 players are left after a leave/quit, set game state to inactive
and lose stats related to the previous game

add a 'reload' command to reload cards

deal with the game-winning scenario (ie, announce a win when one player
gets to config['max_points'])

print index numbers for judge choices once all the cards are in

status command should print out card choices in wait_czar

non-czar shouldn't be able to pick a winner

once a winner is picked, maybe try running round 2 (tied to endgame
code, problably)
