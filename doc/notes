basic structure of a CAH game is:

init: load cards, load config, join irc channel

wait for start command

then loop:
add users to game
deal cards to users
show question
collect answers
wait for winner selection
record results

once game is done, record stats, reset deck, wait for start command



commands we want to have:

join
start
play/pick
winner/pick
cards
status
score/shame
detail cardnum - shows info on card

ideally, commands are just entered, and if they don't make sense, are
ignored.  additional verbiage is also ignored (pick 0 2 because why
not).  if someone says, 'pick up the pace,' it's ignored (no numbers).
commands that take no args are ignored if there's any trailing stuff
('start making sense' doesn't start a game).

commands issued to the cardbot via private message are, where sensible,
responded via pm as well -- cards, status, score, detail.
